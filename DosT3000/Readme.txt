This is the original T3000 controller project from 1997. It was a mature project installed in a number of buildings at the time. The code runs on an embedded PC and uses an add-in card to plug into several input and output interface boards. A display, keypad and mouse are supported which provided a handy operator interface right at the controller, usually in the boiler/chiller room. The exact same code ran on a regular PC which was normally located in the building operator's office, or remotely connected using a modem, which served as the front end to the overall system. 

The code compiles under Borland C++ 4.5. The system used a small self-made RTOS and relies on the now obsolete BGI graphics api so the user interface must be redone in the new environment. The T3000 exectable is also included in this folder, it can be run on a Windows PC using a 'DOSbox' emulator and is useful for seeing how the application used to operate.
