Software developing
-------------------


A software developing involve:
         - designing
         - developing
         - testing
         - documenting 


I. Designing the Application
=============================


Before a program can be implemented, it needs to be thoughtfully design:

    1. design the software
    2. a functional specification provides a means of communicating the
       product's design
    3. a prototype version is a useful way of determining how well the
       interface is designed
    4. an internal design of the program identifies the implementation
       details


 1. Designing the Software
 -------------------------
  In a few words the designing of the software means:

       a. defining the feature set that becomes the basis for the program.
          Usually this set is narrowed from a multitude of features the program
          could contain.
       b. designing the user-interface: the visual presentation of the program


 2. The Functional Specification
 -------------------------------
  The functional specification is a document listing all the interface elements
 that are visible to the user, with an explanation of what the program is
 expected to do when the user activates or interacts with these interface
 elements.
  Once the features that are to be in the program and the manner in  which those
 features will be presented to the user have been identified, these concepts
 should be documented.
  The functional specification provide the basis for the development team,
 quality assuarance team, documentation team and marketing team.


 3. Prototyping
 --------------
  A software prototype is a means of visually experiencing the project's
 essence. You get a feeling of the flow through the prototype program. You
 gain a better appreciation of how the final project will look and feel.
 The prototype is an excellent means for marketing and sales people, to try
 out the program's interface and provide feedback on how well the design
 does or does not work.


 4. Architectural design
 -----------------------
  Define the internal structure of the program. We will make use of
  object-oriented design metodology. It identify the objects (classes) the
  program will be composed of, their attributes (data members) and the
  operations (methods) these objects can perform.
  Once the objects were identified, we need to define how these objects
  will communicate with one another.

The software development is a time consuming process. The time expended in
designing of the application is going to save a lot more amount of time later
in developing process.
No step can be cast in stone. To avoid having to re-implement parts of the
application is important to get as much feedback, and as early in the
development process, as it is possible.


II. Developing the Application
==============================

 The developing process involve many tasks. I just want to mention two important
tools need in this process: project management software and version control
software.
