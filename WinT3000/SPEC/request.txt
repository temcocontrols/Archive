t3000Request
------------


After a port is installed and a connection was established, an
application can make request to the remote panels using t3000Request() function:

  DInt t3000Request(
           DInt command, DInt arg,  DByte *data, DUint *length , DInt dest,
		   DInt network, DInt others=0, DInt timeout=TIMEOUT_NETCALL,
		   DByte *returnargs=NULL, DInt *length_returnargs=NULL,
           DByte *sendargs=NULL, DInt length_sendargs=0, DByte bytearg=0
           );

  command  -  define the request. If is of type 'CommandRequest'.
              (see define.h  for 'CommandRequest')
  arg      -  define the argument of a command ( 2 bytes )
  data     -  pointer to data buffer. A write command will write data from
              this buffer. A read command will read data in this buffer.
  length   -  pointer to data length.
              If it is a write request, 'length' should be the length
              of data to be send.
              If it is a read request, 'length' will be set by client to the
              data length read from the remote panel.
  dest     -  the remote panel number where the request will be directed
  network  -  the network number of the remote panel
  others   -  BACnetConfirmedRequestPDU = 0x00   - confirm request; the client
                                        wait for the request to be confirmed
              BACnetUnconfirmedRequestPDU = 0x01 - unconfirmed request; the
                                        client does not wait for confirmation
  timeout  -  timeout, the client wait for 'timeout' seconds before to return
              an timeout error code
  returnargs        - pointer to an additional data buffer returned by some commands
  length_returnargs - pointer to the length of data returned in 'returnargs'
                      buffer
  sendargs          - pointer to an additional data buffer to be sent  by some
                      commands
  length_sendargs   - length of data pointed by 'sendargs' to be sent
  bytearg  - define the third byte as argument of a command ( 1 bytes )

The function returns:
     SUCCESS    - the request was accomplished with succes
     ERROR_COM  - errror request
     USER_ABORT - error request; the user aborted the request

The t3000Request() function is implemented in t3000Request.cpp.
This source file should be added to the project.
