	[Maurice Duteau]  The ram needs enough battery power for a few
days, so the CAP may need to be bigger. and the FLASH needs to hold alot
of things that the ram does, so it may also need to be bigger. One thing
I was thinking about with Doru is to make the CPU, crystal, RAM, Flash
and CAP on a module. This way we can upgrade minis easily. Also,
repairing minis will be easier since we can check them with "Known Good"
CPU modules. Whatever memory chips you and Francois decide on, make this
layout in a module which plugs into the motherboard. A low end module
can even be designed into the mini 8x8 which is not quite finished. This
will open the way for a high end and low end modules which can plug into
mini 8x8's or mini64's depending on the application.

		Approved. What I hope to get from you in return is to
make ALL NEW BOARD LAYOUTS, (including the Mini 8x8 and the Mini 64)
take into account the CPU module I mentioned above.

	PS: You can tell everyone the recent 4 day trade show went very
well. I expect we will be getting a least a couple new dealers and a
couple new projects because of it. In the trade show environement, it is
very important to look beautiful, even if the features are the same as
always. One thing you could do to help us in the period we are waiting
for WinT3000 is to allow SuperVGA 256 bit color images on the GRP
displays and icons.
