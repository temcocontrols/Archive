Hi, Maurice

I am really frustrated the way Tricom treat us. Of, course
they are surprised I am on holiday. We are part of Temco
warehouse. You are talking about millions but who are 
creating those milions and how, you don't care.  Actually,
I don't care about your milions, you can share as many as
you want but I will care about myself. I learned this from
you. I took one week off to relax a little bit and to clear my
mind. 
Nothing else is going on. Usually I took the drive home,
not in the last month and not in the future. Right now, this
is not a place where to come with pleasure at work and
without any clear future. To invoke the past and the future
opportunities as a way to keep me here has no value.
On a short term I want 60K paid from January 1st. 1998
and two more weeks of holiday for this year. If I will do
overtime I want to be paid or move that overtime toward
holiday.
To prove me you still keep interest in me, the above 
income should be reflected in the April 15th paycheck.
If this will not happen, I will understand clear your position
vis-a-vis my person and I will take it as a signal to 
start switching my way.

Regards,
Adrian.
